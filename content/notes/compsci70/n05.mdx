incident
-between edges and verticies

neighbors/adjacent
-between verticies when there's an edge

Various names for different subsets of a graph:

| Name          | No edge repeats | No vertex repeats | End @ Start | All edges once |
| ------------- | :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------: | :------------: |
| (simple) path |                 |         x         |             |                |
| cycle         |                 |         x         |      x      |                |
| walk          |                 |                   |             |                |
| tour          |        x        |                   |      x      |                |
| Eulerian walk |        x        |                   |             |       x        |
| Eulerian tour |        x        |                   |      x      |       x        |

Theorem. (Euler's Theorem)
-An undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ has an Eulerian tour if and only if $G$ is even degree and connected (except for isolated verticies).
