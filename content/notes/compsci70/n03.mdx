## Weak/Simple Induction

Basic idea:

$$
	(P(0) \land (P(k) \Longrightarrow P(k+1))) \Longrightarrow (\forall n \in \mathbb{N}) P(n)
$$

## Stregthen Hypothesis

Sometimes, showing $P(k) \Longrightarrow P(k+1)$ is really hard/impossible. In such problems, find $Q(x)$ such that

$$
	Q(x) \Longrightarrow P(x),
$$

$Q(0)$ is true, and show $Q(k) \Longrightarrow Q(k+1)$ instead.

## Strong Induction

Basic idea:

$$
	\left( \bigwedge_{i=0}^k P(i) \right) \Longrightarrow P(k+1)
$$

This looks harder, but it's actually easier to prove since more statements can be assumed to prove the same thing.

- Hypothesis for Weak Induction:
	- $P(k)$
- Hypothesis for Strong Induction:
	- $P(0)$
	- $P(1)$
	- $P(2)$
	- $\ldots$
	- $P(k)$
