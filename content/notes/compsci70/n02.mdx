## Direct Proof

For some statement $P \Longrightarrow Q$, begin by assuming $P$.

## Proof by Contraposition

For some statement $P \Longrightarrow Q$, instead prove $\neg Q \Longrightarrow \neg P$.

## Proof by Contradiction

For some statement $P$, assume $\neg P$. Establish that $\neg P \Longrightarrow R$ and $\neg P \Longrightarrow \neg R$. Since $R \land \neg R$ is a contradiction, $P$ is true.

## Proof "by Cases"

Partition the universe into multiple cases.

### Example

> $(\exists x, y \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q})(x^y \in \mathbb{Q})$

_Proof._ Let $x,y = \sqrt{2}$. Proceed by cases, where one must be true:

#### Case 1: $x^y$ is rational

The claim is true.

#### Case 2: $x^y$ is irrational

Thus, $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational. Instead, let $x = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$. Then,

$$
	x^y = \left( \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2
$$

so the claim is true. This is known as a non-constructive proof.

non-constructive proof
-$P$ is true, but the situation required for $P$ is unclear
