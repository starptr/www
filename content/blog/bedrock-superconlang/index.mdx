Conlang, by its loosest definition, is a language that was created by someone. Therefore, as long as I define some rules as a way to communicate, I've effectively created a conlang. So here is my idea:

## Bedrock

The name is inspired by [Bedrock Linux](https://bedrocklinux.org/). In this language, grammar and vocabulary from any existing natural language is valid. Other conlangs are also valid, but must meet a minimum requirement that shows its robustness to communicate arbitrary ideas (this requirement is not yet defined but is guaranteed to validate every natural language).

Furthermore, vocabulary can be mixed and matched so each sentence (or its equivalent in the current language) isn't confined to one language.

### Mixing and Matching

Let us assume that every language has some equivalent of a sentence and a word. Each word has an arbitrary part of speech.
