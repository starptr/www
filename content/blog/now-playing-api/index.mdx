Here's a cool widget that shows what I'm currently listening to on Spotify, heavily inspired by Discord's integration:

<NowPlaying style={{ marginBottom: rhythm(1) }} />

To prevent hitting Spotify's API rate limit (and to hide credentials ðŸ˜¬), I'm running the [now-playing-api](https://github.com/starptr/now-playing-api) that I scripted a few days ago on a cheap AWS Lightsail instance.

I started using Spotify a lot more in the past few months, so I've organized a few playlists. Here are three that I listen to the most:

## Energetic Pop

This list contains iconic pop music that all have a party-like energy.

## Classic

This list has most of my instrumental pieces, totaling +26 hours at the time of writing.
