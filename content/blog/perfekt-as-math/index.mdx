Perfect Competition, or as I like to abbreviate it, **Perfekt**, is your standard paired Supply vs Demand market graph along with a firm graph where Marginal Revenue = Demand = Average Revenue = Price.

You can interact with it below: (See [this page](/proj/microecon/perfekt) to interact with only this applet)

## Definitions

$C_S = S(0)$ is the intersection between $S$ and the y-axis.

$C_D = D(0)$ is the intersection between $D$ and the y-axis.

$C_{MC}$ is an arbitrary constant that shifts $MC$ up or down.

$p_{mkt}$ is the market price.

$p_{eq}$ is the profit-maximizing price.

$p_{min}$ is the minimum of $AVC$.

## The default $MC$ function is awfully complicated!!

Yup, I was having trouble finding a decent function such that all of the cool things like the intersection between $P$ and $ATC$ and $P_{mkt}$ and $AVC$, so I asked Taiga to engineer one using <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rsukldgnp8">Desmos</a>:

The final function is very cursed:

$$
MC(q) = \frac{4.4(0.134q + 4.7)^2 - 12(0.134q + 4.7) + 50}{3.2(0.134q + 4.7) - 13.14} 8.4 - 125
$$

### Thought Process

The equation was written so that it could be manipulated as easily as possible. We already knew the general shape was going to have a sharp descent from the positive y-axis, and then slowly "climb up". The "climb up" part could be approximated by a function that has a slant asymptote. Therefore, we began with a rational function with a quotient whose degree was 1 for a nice linear asymptote. This is why the numerator looks like a quadratic function (think of $0.134q + 4.7$ as $X$) and the denominator looks linear. Then, to perform linear transformations, we replaced $X$ with $mq + b$ for horizontal stretching/squishing and shifting and took the entire function and replaced it with $MR + B$ for vertical stretching/squishing and shifting.

## Why?

As I was watching [Matt Pedlow's AP Microeconomics series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGgviqq4847-M3z5bOgGoX1fWVshEsLL) for this year's exam, I noticed that we can actually define many of the relationships between quantity and price using discrete calculus. So I thought it would be interesting to talk about how that would span out.

Also, it's always nice to be able to have an interactive visualization of things, and I haven't seen anything for microeconomics anywhere else.

## Mathematical Formalization

Let me show you how some of these functions are calculated from $MC$.

### Defining $TC$ in terms of $MC$

The definition of Marginal Cost ($MC$) is the difference in the Total Cost ($TC$) of producing the currenth $n$th good minus the $TC$ of producing the last good, $(n-1)$th. Using notation from my post on [discrete derivatives](/blog/discrete-derivative), we can define $MC$ as so:

$$
\begin{aligned}
MC(q) &\coloneqq TC(q) - TC(q - 1) \\
	&= \Delta TC(q-1) \\
MC(q + 1) &= \Delta TC(q) \\
MC(q+1) \Delta I(q) &= \Delta TC(q) \\
\sum_{q = 0}^q MC(q + 1) \Delta I(q) &= \sum_{q = 0}^q \Delta TC(q) \\
	&= TC(q) - TC(0) \\
TC(q) &= TC(0) + \sum_{q = 0}^q MC(q + 1) \Delta I(q) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

By the way, both $MC$ and $TC$ map $Q \to P$, where $Q$ is the set of nonnegative integers,[^1] and $P$ is the set of reals with a unit of economic value, such as dollars.[^2] (In the app above, $Q$ has a different meaning: the domain that will be plotted in the graph.)

[^1]: The visualization connects points with consecutive quantities with a line segment, which is why the curves look continuous.
[^2]: Note that this definition is not formal.

As a side note, we define a special case for $MC(0) \coloneqq TC(0)$ since the general definition results in a term $TC(-1)$, even though $-1 \notin Q$.

### Defining $ATC$ in terms of $MC$

We can define Average Total Cost ($ATC$) similarly, but beware that since it is calculated with respect to the quantity of goods, its domain is actually $Q - \{0\}$. That is, it doesn't make sense to talk about the average cost per good when no goods have been produced. So, $ATC \colon Q-\{0\} \to P$, and

$$
ATC(q) \coloneqq \frac{TC(q)}{q}
$$

We can also define $MC$ in terms of $ATC$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
ATC(q) &= \frac{TC(q)}{q} \\
q \cdot ATC(q) &= TC(q) \\
\Delta [q \cdot ATC](q) &= \Delta TC(q) \\
q \Delta ATC(q) &= MC(q + 1) \\
MC(q) &= (q + 1) \Delta ATC(q + 1) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Market Price

Since algebraically finding the market price is hard, this approximates by finding the closest quantity $q_{mkt}$ such that

$$
p_{mkt} \coloneqq S(q_{mkt}) = D(q_{mkt}).
$$

And if

$$
p_{eq} \coloneqq MC(q_{eq}) = ATC(q_{eq})
$$

is close enough to $p_{mkt}$, about $1$ unit, then we'll say the firm is making _approximately normal profit_.

Normally, the firm tries to produce at the price $p_c = MR(q_c) = MC(q_c)$. For **Perfekt** firms, $MR(q) = p_{mkt}$; that is, they are price takers. So,

$$
p_c = p_{mkt} = MC(q_c).
$$

We can compare $p_{eq}$ and $p_c$ to find the _sign_ of the economic profit the firm is making:

| Comparison     | Economic State  |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| $p_c < p_{eq}$ | Economic Loss   |
| $p_c = p_{eq}$ | Normal Profit   |
| $p_c > p_{eq}$ | Economic Profit |

## Shutdown Point

If the firm is making an economic loss, we can also find

$$
p_{min} \coloneqq \min_{q \in Q} (AVC(q))
$$

and compare $p_{c}$ and $p_{min}$ like so:

| Comparison        | Should the firm shutdown? |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| $p_{min} < p_{c}$ | No                        |
| $p_{min} = p_{c}$ | Doesn't Matter[^3]        |
| $p_{min} > p_{c}$ | Yes                       |

[^3]: With respect to loss minimization.
