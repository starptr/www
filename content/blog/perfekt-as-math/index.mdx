Perfect Competition, or as I like to abbreviate it, **Perfekt**, is your standard paired Supply vs Demand market graph along with a firm graph where Marginal Revenue = Demand = Average Revenue = Price.

## Why?

As I was watching [Matt Pedlow's AP Microeconomics series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGgviqq4847-M3z5bOgGoX1fWVshEsLL) for this year's exam, I noticed that we can actually define many of the relationships between quantity and price using discrete calculus, something that sounds fancier than it really is. So I thought it would be interesting to talk about how that would span out.

Also, it's always nice to be able to have an interactive visualization of things, and I haven't seen anything for microeconomics anywhere else.

## Mathematical Formalization

The definition of Marginal Cost ($MC$) is the difference in the Total Cost ($TC$) of producing the currenth $n$th good minus the $TC$ of producing the last good, $(n-1)$th. Using notation from my post on [discrete derivatives](/blog/discrete-derivative), we can define $MC$ as so:

$$
\begin{aligned}
MC(q) &\coloneqq TC(q) - TC(q - 1) \\
	&\coloneqq \Delta TC(q-1)
\end{aligned}
$$

By the way, both $MC$ and $TC$ map $Q \to P$, where $Q$ is the set of nonnegative integers,[^2] and $P$ is the set of reals with a unit of economic value, such as dollars.[^1]

We can define Average Total Cost ($ATC$) similarly, but beware that since it is calculated with respect to the quantity of goods, its domain is actually $Q - \{0\}$. That is, it doesn't make sense to talk about the average cost per good when no goods have been produced. So, $ATC \colon Q-\{0\} \to P$, and

$$
ATC(q) \coloneqq \frac{TC(q)}{q}
$$

[^2]: The visualization connects points with consecutive quantities with a line segment, which is why the curves look continuous.
[^1]: Note that this definition is not formal.
