Consider the following:

| Hand              | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| ![Zero](./0.png)  | 0     |
| ![One](./1.jpg)   | 1     |
| ![Two](./2.jpg)   | 2     |
| ![Three](./3.jpg) | 3     |
| ![Four](./4.jpg)  | 4     |
| ![Five](./5.jpg)  | 5     |
| ![Six](./6.png)   | 6     |
| ![Seven](./7.png) | 7     |
| ![Eight](./8.png) | 8     |
| ![Nine](./9.png)  | 9     |

If each hand represents a digit in base $10$, then two hands can express anywhere from $0$ to $99$.
