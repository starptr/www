For the first time in months, I listened to Georges Bizet's Symphony in C, and I
almost forgot how strongly I associated piece this with Harvard's Summer School
Program.

The program took place from mid-June to mid-May, so there was enough time for
there to be a summer orchestra. Incidentally, we also played Saint-SaÃ«ns's Suite
Pour Orchestre and his Cello Concerto No. 1. They're all amazingly beautiful,
but as a 3rd-stand Violin II player, I enjoyed Bizet far more onstage compared
to the other two.

Unfortunately, I don't have the musical background (yet :)) to analytically
explain why. But in simple terms, it was exciting, lively, thrilling. All of the
abstract emotions from the program that imprinted in the back of my mind were
strongly associated with this piece. (This is true for the other two as well,
but more for Bizet.) I felt as if I re-unlocked some of that memory with its
associated, strongly nostalgic energy, and re-locked it back when the piece
ended.

What can I take away from this? For me specifically, I have a strong link with
one of my physical senses, hearing, and no other sense can substitute for its
ability to recall strong but abstract long-forgotten emotions. However, not
everyone has a BFF relationship with their sense of hearing. But I trust that
every human has the ability to use one of their senses as a key for properly
unlocking and relocking something as strong as pure serotonin. Some people use
their sense of taste. A well-done platter of their favorite Grandma's cookies
can send them back straight into childhood. Some people might use their sense of
smell. The correct oakwood might bring back memories of a summer cabin. I
imagine this is difficult to consistently do, but I hope every person can get a
taste of this feeling at least once in life.
